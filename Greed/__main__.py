Things we need to do in main:
    Import all 8 (or 9) classes
    Set some global variables:
        Frame Rate
        Max width and height of window
        Cell size of an individual cell in the window's grid
        The font size (presumably, this will always be the same as cell size)
        The number of columns
        The number of rows
        The caption (name of the game)
        The starting number of rocks
